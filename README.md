# PoSh-Steam
Powershell module for Valve's Steam platform. 

Currently exports the single command `Switch-SteamUser`, additional commands may be added in the future.

## Switch-SteamUser
Switch between previously logged in Steam accounts without password reentry or additional Steam Guard codesâ€”basically 'Remember Me' on steroids.  First time logins will fall back to password entry, and after successful login (with 'Remember Me' ticked) additional logins with `Switch-SteamUser` should work as intended.
